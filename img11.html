                    <p>A long list of New Year’s resolutions can feel
                        overwhelming,
                        but making a few small adjustments each month can make
                        it
                        easier to stick with your goals. Aim for three small
                        diet
                        changes each month, and by the end of the year, you’ll
                        develop healthy, long-lasting habits.</p>

                    <div class="para2">
                        <p>As Jan. 1 comes around, many of us feel inspired to
                            start
                            fresh and make healthier choices. However, it’s easy
                            to
                            fall into the cycle of setting strict New Year’s
                            diet
                            resolutions only to lose motivation within a few
                            weeks.
                            The fresh year often signals a time of promise and
                            hope.
                            We promise ourselves we’re going to eat right and
                            get
                            into shape, and we hope we can stick with our
                            resolutions.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="para3">
                        <p> But, unfortunately, it’s just too hard to make many
                            changes all at once. Instead, what if we focused on
                            gradual, sustainable changes that build a balanced
                            lifestyle? This year, let’s shift from quick-fix
                            goals
                            to achievable adjustments we can maintain year
                            round.</p>

                    <div class="para4">
                        <p>Make a Few Small Changes Every Month
                            Here’s a suggestion for you. Go ahead and write a
                            to-do
                            list, but don’t try to plan all your changes at
                            once. In
                            fact, I’m going to suggest that you tackle just
                            three
                            small changes in January – another three in
                            February,
                            three more in March, and so on until the end of the
                            year. And here’s why. If you work on establishing
                            just
                            three new habits for a month, you won’t be
                            overwhelmed
                            with trying to focus on too many things at once.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="para5">
                        <p>By the end of the month, the three new habits will be
                            part of your routine, and you’ll be ready to take on
                            three more changes in the following month.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="para6">
                        <p>Keep Your Diet Resolutions Going All Year Long
                            By focusing on small changes each month, you’re more
                            likely to sustain your progress throughout the year.
                            Suppose you start with three changes in January that
                            cut
                            out around 100 calories a day. By the fifth month,
                            you’ll have accumulated a series of 15 small changes
                            that could save you up to 500 calories a day. Think
                            about the difference this could make to your
                            well-being
                            by the end of the year.</p>
