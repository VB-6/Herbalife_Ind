                    <p>Setting realistic New Year’s resolutions can be
                        challenging, but don’t be discouraged. Even small
                        changes to your diet can lead to healthy habits over
                        time. Discover practical tips for overcoming obstacles,
                        staying motivated and building lasting habits for a
                        healthier lifestyle.</p>

                    <div class="para2">
                        <p>Do you remember the resolutions you made last year?
                            If you’re like most people, you probably vowed to
                            eat better, get more exercise and maybe lose weight.
                            So looking back, how did it go? Did you accomplish
                            all you set out to do? Or did you start the year
                            strong only to fall back into old patterns, making
                            the same resolutions again this year?

                            If you find yourself making the same resolutions
                            each January, don’t be discouraged – it’s a sign
                            that taking care of yourself matters to you. Each
                            time you set goals for weight loss or healthier
                            habits, you’re committing to better health, even if
                            you’re not fully there yet. Just because you repeat
                            these promises doesn’t mean you didn’t make progress
                            last year.

                            Starting the year with plans to improve shows your
                            dedication, and each small step moves you closer to
                            your goals. Remember, incremental changes add up
                            over time, and each effort you make is progress
                            worth celebrating</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="para3">
                        <p> If you’ve managed to cut back on soda, snack a bit
                            less or cook at home more often, then you’re already
                            progressing. Building small changes in your daily
                            habits can lead to real, lasting benefits over time.
                            Simple changes like reducing your sugar intake or
                            adding a few more veggies each day can really add
                            up. In the new year, focus on expanding these gains
                            little by little.

                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="para4">
                        <p>When setting goals, it’s tempting to aim high and
                            take on several new habits at once. But developing
                            healthy eating habits is often easier when you work
                            on one small change at a time. Think about which
                            changes are most important to you and focus there.
                            By creating manageable goals, you’re more likely to
                            make lasting changes that support your long-term
                            success.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="para5">
                        <p>If you struggle with making healthy choices,
                            identifying the obstacles and temptations can help
                            you find solutions. For example, if eating balanced
                            meals is challenging, and you often rely on fast
                            food, the issue might be that cooking every night
                            feels too time-consuming. Cooking in batches and
                            freezing portions or setting aside time on Sundays
                            to prep a few meals can make healthy eating easier.
                            Consider using a meal plan, depending on your weight
                            goals.

                    <div class="para6">
                        <p>When it comes to developing healthy eating habits,
                            success often lies in preparation and planning. If
                            your goal is to eat more vegetables, start by buying
                            fresh or frozen produce and incorporating it
                            gradually. Adding a side salad, roasted veggies or a
                            fresh fruit snack can feel more manageable than
                            overhauling your diet overnight.</p>
