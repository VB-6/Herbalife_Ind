                <h1 style="color: green;">10 Heart-Healthy Foods and Snacks to Add to Your Grocery List</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <div class="para1">
                    <p>According to the National Heart Centre Singapore, an unhealthy diet can put people at a higher risk for heart disease. What we put in our bodies certainly impacts our health, so it’s important to incorporate heart-healthy foods into our everyday diet. Heart-healthy meals start with... surprise! ...heart-healthy ingredients. Here are some tips for selecting and preparing foods that support heart health</p>

                    <div class="para2">
                        <p>A heart-healthy diet, also known as a cardiac diet, is one that calls for a variety of good-for-you foods – including lean proteins, plenty of fruits and vegetables, adequate amounts of fiber and modest amounts of sugar, salt and saturated fat. Sounds like a healthy diet to me!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="para3">
                        <p> A heart-healthy diet not only supports the health of your heart, but it also supports your overall health in a number of ways. Low-fat protein foods keep you full and give your body what it needs to build and repair important body proteins, all while keeping your total fat and saturated fat in check.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="para4">
                        <p>The protein that you eat every day provides the basic building blocks that your body needs to perform literally hundreds of functions. Protein is found in a variety of plant and animal foods, but saturated fats often tag along – especially in the case of animal proteins.

                            Meats naturally contain more saturated fat and cholesterol than poultry, and poultry has more fat than seafood. If you eat dairy products, it’s best to choose fat-free or low fat. Plant proteins– like soy proteins, beans and lentils – are naturally cholesterol-free and low in saturated fat. And fish is a good source of heart-healthy omega-3 fats.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="para5">
                        <p>Carbohydrates are the primary fuel for your body’s engine. Their fiber content can also help fill you up, which can help you control your weight. Many fruits and vegetables are rich sources of potassium, which supports healthy blood pressure. Soluble fiber – found in apples, oranges, carrots, oats, barley and beans – traps water as well as cholesterol in the digestive tract, so it helps control the amount of cholesterol circulating in the blood.

                            Some fruits and vegetables are also good sources of nitrate, a compound used by the body to make nitric oxide, which supports the health of your blood vessels. Do your best to limit your intake of carbohydrates from sugars and highly refined grains, which offer a lot less nutrition and more calories per bite.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="para6">
                        <p>Keep your focus on vegetables, whole fruits, whole grains and whole-grain products to provide the carbs your body needs. Try to reduce your intake of sweets, juices, sugary drinks and refined grain products, like white rice, and “white” flour products, like regular pasta, white bread, cereals and crackers.</p>
